Review: "I've been using the ProMax Blender for 3 months now. The motor is incredibly powerful - it crushes ice in seconds. However, I've noticed it gets quite loud during operation, which can be annoying early in the morning. The 10-year warranty gives me peace of mind. Assembly was straightforward, took about 5 minutes. At $199, it's pricier than competitors but feels premium. My only complaint is the rubber feet aren't grippy enough, so it slides on my marble countertop during heavy blending. Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase and would recommend it to friends who value power over quietness."
