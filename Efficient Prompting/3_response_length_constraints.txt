Review: "I bought this wireless mouse last week. The battery life is amazing - lasts for months! However, the scroll wheel is too sensitive and I often scroll past what I'm trying to read. The ergonomics are great for my hand size. Price is reasonable compared to competitors. Would buy again despite the scroll issue."
